# Football-analytics
This project was completed as part of a university database systems assignment. It uses PostgreSQl to analyse a football tournament databse and the main analysis is completed through SQL views and Pl/pgSQL functions.

## Database Design: Football Match Database

This database models a simplified international football tournament system. It stores information about matches, national teams, players, goals, and disciplinary cards.

### Entity Summary

| Table | Description |
|---|---|
| `Matches` | Stores where and when each international match was played |
| `Teams` | Stores the national teams that take part in matches |
| `Involves` | Links each match to its two competing teams and records which team was the home side |
| `Players` | Stores player details, including name, birthday, team membership, and playing position |
| `Goals` | Records who scored, when they scored, and an optional goal quality rating |
| `Cards` | Records disciplinary cards issued to players during matches |

## Schema Details

### Domains

The schema uses two custom domains to make constraints clearer.

#### `GameTime`

Represents time in minutes since the game started.

| Constraint | Description |
|---|---|
| Type | `integer` |
| Valid range | `0` to `90` |

```sql
create domain GameTime as integer check (value between 0 and 90);
```

#### `CardColour`

Represents the type of disciplinary card issued to a player.

| Constraint | Description |
|---|---|
| Type | `varchar(6)` |
| Valid values | `red`, `yellow` |

```sql
create domain CardColour as varchar(6) check (value in ('red','yellow'));
```

## Table Details

### `Matches`

Stores where and when each international match was played.

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | `integer` | Unique match identifier and primary key |
| `city` | `varchar(50)` | City where the match was played |
| `played_on` | `date` | Date when the match was played |

```sql
create table Matches (
    id          integer,
    city        varchar(50) not null,
    played_on   date not null,
    primary key (id)
);
```

### `Teams`

Stores the national sides that take part in matches.

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|

```sql
create table Teams (
    id          integer,
    country     varchar(50) unique not null,
    primary key (id)
);
```

### `Involves`

Represents the relationship between matches and teams. Each match should involve two teams, and this table records whether each team is the home side.

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `match` | `integer` | Foreign key referencing `Matches(id)` |
| `team` | `integer` | Foreign key referencing `Teams(id)` |
| `is_home` | `boolean` | Indicates whether the team is the home team in the match |

| Key / Constraint | Description |
|---|---|
| Primary key | Composite key on `(match, team)` |
| Foreign key | `match` references `Matches(id)` |
| Foreign key | `team` references `Teams(id)` |

```sql
create table Involves (
    match   integer     not null,
    team    integer     not null,
    is_home boolean     not null,
    primary key (match, team),
    foreign key (match) references Matches(id),
    foreign key (team)  references Teams(id)
);
```

### `Players`

| `position` | `varchar(20)` | Player’s usual playing position |

| Key / Constraint | Description |
|---|---|
| Primary key | `id` |
| Foreign key | `member_of` references `Teams(id)` |

```sql
create table Players (
    id          integer,
    name        varchar(50) not null,
    birthday    date,
    member_of   integer not null,
    position    varchar(20) not null,
    primary key (id),
    foreign key (member_of) references Teams(id)
);
```

### `Goals`

Records goals scored during matches.

| Column | Type | Description |

## Relationship Overview

| Relationship | Description |
|---|---|
| `Matches` to `Teams` | Many-to-many relationship through `Involves` |
| `Teams` to `Players` | One team can have many players |
| `Matches` to `Goals` | One match can contain many goals |
| `Players` to `Goals` | One player can score many goals |
| `Matches` to `Cards` | One match can contain many cards |
| `Players` to `Cards` | One player can receive many cards |

## Schema Summary

The database is centred around football matches. Each match is connected to two teams through the `Involves` table. Players belong to teams, while goals and cards link individual players to specific match events. This design allows SQL queries to analyse player performance, team results, goal scoring patterns, and disciplinary records.
